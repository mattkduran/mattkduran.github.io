# Casting my vote
Around two months back, I received an email from my then employer letting us know that we were in the Best of Portland contest again with the local paper,  the Willamette Week, and wanted us to vote for our company. For those not in the know, the Best of Portland is an annual voting contest put on by the Willamette Week for Portlanders to rank the best restaurants, bars, camps, child care, you name it, and there is probably a category.

After attending a webinar put on by Black Hills Infosec (https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/webcast-free-tools-how-to-use-developer-tools-and-javascript-in-webapp-pentests/), I decided to see what categories were open this year and cast my ballot. Black Hill's webinar had been on the built-in developer tools in Firefox/Chrome and using them to examine websites. One of the critical pieces of advice I took away from it -- leave the console and network tabs open all the time because you never know what you'll find. Boy, were they right! Heeding that advice, I browsed most of the day with the console open while I worked to get into the habit and noticed a UUID that just seemed different from the other calls being made.

*API calls in Firefox's network log*

bestofapi.scenethink.io seemed to be the API this data was coming from for this particular category. Ever the curious person, I decided to just open it and see what was there. Opening the URL directly in Firefox, I could see every single vote cast in this category. Not only this category but every single vote cast in the Best of Portland 2020 race! With also the first and last name as well as the personal IP address from that device...Uh oh.

Removing the ballot id at the end of the URL begat every voter on the platform, not just the Willamette Week but also other news organizations that have used this platform for "best of" votes and the test groups Scenethink's API showed.

# Who can I talk to?

Seeing how massive this leak was and that if anyone else went to that URL, they too could view this information, I felt that I immediately had to reach out. But to who? Over 47 days through emails, I finally got confirmation that it was good to post about this. 

After discovering the API's contents, starting here at https://bop.wweek.com/voter/index, a cookie alert linked me to a Privacy Policy (https://devias.io/privacy-policy). Devias' privacy policy took me to a contact form where I needed to agree to the cookie terms before sending an email. I couldn't understand what the settings were telling me -- it looks like part of this is some "Lorem Ipsum" and wasn't actually saying anything. I sent an email through the contact form to see if I could talk to someone and see if this was even something that they handled but never heard back from them through this whole process.

*Cookie settings on website*

I thought smaller, bestofapi.scenethink.io -- could there be a Scenethink website? After some incredibly easy googling, I landed at https://scenethink.com/ and started searching for their privacy policy, thinking that whoever would be at privacy@scenethink.com would want to know this is happening immediately. On their website, I found their intercom portal for their knowledge base and saw a chat option. I sent a chat through their portal to see if I could talk with someone about concerns with their Best Of API and waited. And waited.

About a week later, one of the support staff from Scenethink got in touch with me and confirmed that scenethink.io was their domain. I let them know all my findings -- the email addresses, first and last names, IP addresses, and a few hashed and salted passwords I had found in the output as well -- and a little while later I received a 401 error if I went to the API's URL again. 

First and foremost, I don't know how to categorize this problem -- is it an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) or just an API that doesn't require authentication? In all likelihood, this was a server to server API call that didn't have any kind of secrets set up for it and was never intended to be seen by people. 

# So how could this have been fixed?

  * Some form of authentication needed to happen.
```	
No one should just happen upon this data by accident, only people who need to see the information should be able to.
```
  * Your API should not give extra information that is not required
  ```
	If I had gone to https://bestofapi.scenethink.io/ballots, I should be required to provide a ballot ID before something is returned. I should not be able to see every single ballot that was ever made for this platform.
    ```
  * Impose some kind of restriction on the amount of data returned at once.
  ```
	This goes hand in hand with the previous note -- I shouldn't be able to view all of the records since the API started accepting requests. If someone requests a lot more data than expected, this should be logged somewhere and require a follow-up.
    ```
  * Finally, follow the OWASP top 10 guide on API Security (https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/)
```
      OWASP is, by far, one of the leading organizations on security, and their recommendations are always spot on.
```

If you provide an API to the internet, make sure that its security is up to par -- regardless of whether you think that no one will see it. I'm glad that
